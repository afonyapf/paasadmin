# Platform Administration System

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application for managing a multi-tenant workspace platform. The system provides administrators with tools to manage users, workspaces, tariff plans, templates, custom domains, and audit logs. It follows a modern architecture with a React frontend, Express.js backend, and PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui design system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and bundling

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Pattern**: RESTful API endpoints under `/api` prefix
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store
- **Middleware**: Request logging, authentication, and error handling

### Database Architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured for Neon serverless)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with type-safe queries
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations
- **Connection**: @neondatabase/serverless for edge-compatible connections

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- Session-based authentication for administrators
- Login/logout endpoints with audit logging
- Route protection middleware for API endpoints
- Client-side auth state management with React Query

### Database Schema
The system manages several core entities:
- **Admins**: Platform administrators with role-based access
- **Users**: Platform users with OAuth and blocking capabilities
- **Tariffs**: Pricing plans with feature flags and limits
- **Workspaces**: User workspaces with owner relationships and status tracking
- **Workspace Templates**: Predefined configurations for workspace creation
- **Custom Domains**: Domain management with SSL status tracking
- **Audit Logs**: Complete activity tracking with IP and user agent logging
- **System Metrics**: Performance and usage statistics

### UI Architecture
- **Layout System**: Admin layout with sidebar navigation and header
- **Component Library**: Consistent UI components using Radix primitives
- **Theme System**: CSS custom properties for light/dark mode support
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoint utilities

### API Endpoints
- Authentication: `/api/auth/*`
- User management: `/api/users/*`
- Workspace management: `/api/workspaces/*`
- Tariff management: `/api/tariffs/*`
- Template management: `/api/templates/*`
- Domain management: `/api/domains/*`
- Audit logs: `/api/audit-logs`
- Dashboard stats: `/api/dashboard/stats`

## Data Flow

### Request Flow
1. Client makes authenticated requests to Express API
2. Authentication middleware validates session
3. Route handlers interact with Drizzle ORM
4. Database operations are performed on PostgreSQL
5. Responses are returned with proper error handling
6. React Query manages client-side caching and state

### State Management
- Server state managed by TanStack Query with automatic caching
- Authentication state synchronized between client and server
- Form state managed locally with React Hook Form
- UI state managed with React's built-in state management

### Error Handling
- Server-side error middleware catches and formats errors
- Client-side error boundaries handle React errors
- Toast notifications provide user feedback
- Audit logging captures error events

## External Dependencies

### Core Framework Dependencies
- React ecosystem: react, react-dom, react-router (wouter)
- Backend: express, drizzle-orm, @neondatabase/serverless
- UI: @radix-ui components, tailwindcss, class-variance-authority
- State: @tanstack/react-query, react-hook-form, zod

### Development Tools
- TypeScript for type safety
- Vite for development server and building
- ESBuild for server bundling
- Drizzle Kit for database migrations
- PostCSS for CSS processing

### External Services
- Neon PostgreSQL for database hosting
- Replit integration for development environment
- Session storage using connect-pg-simple

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Vite dev server for frontend with HMR
- tsx for running TypeScript server with hot reload
- Development-specific middleware and error overlays
- Replit-specific plugins for cartographer and error modals

### Production Build
- Frontend: Vite builds optimized static assets
- Backend: ESBuild bundles server code for Node.js
- Static assets served from dist/public directory
- Environment variables for database connections

### Database Management
- Drizzle migrations for schema changes
- Environment-based database URL configuration
- Connection pooling for production workloads
- Automated backup and monitoring (external)

### Key Architectural Decisions

#### Database ORM Choice
- **Problem**: Need type-safe database operations with good PostgreSQL support
- **Solution**: Drizzle ORM for lightweight, type-safe queries
- **Rationale**: Better TypeScript integration than traditional ORMs, performance optimized

#### Frontend State Management
- **Problem**: Complex server state synchronization and caching
- **Solution**: TanStack Query for server state, React state for UI
- **Rationale**: Reduces boilerplate, automatic background refetching, optimistic updates

#### Authentication Strategy
- **Problem**: Secure admin authentication with session management
- **Solution**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store
- **Rationale**: Server-side session security, database persistence, scalable

#### UI Component Strategy
- **Problem**: Consistent, accessible UI components
- **Solution**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui patterns
- **Rationale**: Accessibility built-in, customizable, TypeScript support

#### Build and Development Tools
- **Problem**: Modern development experience with TypeScript
- **Solution**: Vite for frontend, tsx for backend development
- **Rationale**: Fast HMR, modern tooling, TypeScript-first approach
